#python is a typed language = where you know the data types.
 
# python is a explicit type language because we dont need to define the data type here because it automatically know which type you define in your cooding
#implicit-we don't define the type,python automatically define the type of the variable.
#explicit-wwe need to decide the data type of the variable. (java,c++)
